# Performance Fee

Muscadine Labs charges a **1% performance fee** on all vault strategies. This fee is only applied to profits generated by the vault, ensuring you only pay when you earn.

## How the Performance Fee Works

### Fee Structure
- **Rate**: 1% of profits
- **Timing**: Charged when profits are realized
- **Basis**: Only on gains, never on principal
- **Transparency**: All fee calculations visible on-chain

### Example Calculation

<Metric label="Initial Deposit" value="$10,000" hint="Your original investment" />

<Metric label="Vault Value After 1 Year" value="$11,000" hint="Including all gains" />

<Metric label="Profit Generated" value="$1,000" hint="Value increase" />

<Metric label="Performance Fee (1%)" value="$10" hint="Fee on profits only" />

<Metric label="Your Net Return" value="$990" hint="Profit minus fee" />

## When Fees Are Charged

### Realization Events
Performance fees are charged when:
- You withdraw funds from a vault
- The vault rebalances positions
- Periodic fee collection cycles occur
- Vault strategies are optimized

### Fee Collection Process
1. **Calculate Profits**: Determine gains since last fee collection
2. **Apply Fee Rate**: Charge 1% of the profit amount
3. **Deduct from Vault**: Fee is taken from vault assets
4. **Update Records**: Fee collection is recorded on-chain

## Fee Transparency

### On-Chain Verification
All fee collections are:
- **Recorded on blockchain**: Fully transparent and auditable
- **Timestamped**: Exact timing of fee collection
- **Calculated publicly**: Fee amounts can be verified
- **Tracked historically**: Complete fee history available

### Reporting
- **Real-time tracking**: Monitor fees through our interface
- **Historical data**: Complete fee collection history
- **Breakdown details**: See exactly when and why fees were charged

## Why Performance Fees?

## Understanding Your Returns

### Gross vs Net Returns

## Fee Optimization

## Additional Costs

### Gas Fees

- **Not our fees**: These go to network validators
- **Optimization**: We batch operations to minimize gas costs
- **User responsibility**: Gas fees are paid by users, not Muscadine Labs

### Protocol Fees
- **Third-party costs**: Fees charged by underlying DeFi protocols
- **Passed through**: These are not additional Muscadine fees
- **Transparent**: All protocol fees are visible in vault operations
- **Minimal impact**: Typically much smaller than performance fees

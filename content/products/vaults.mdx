# What are Vaults?

Vaults are automated investment strategies that manage your DeFi assets to optimize returns while handling the complexity of decentralized finance protocols.

## Understanding Vaults

Think of a vault as a **smart investment manager** that:

- Takes your assets (USDC, cbBTC, WETH)
- Automatically invests them across multiple DeFi protocols
- Continuously monitors and rebalances positions
- Optimizes for the best risk-adjusted returns
- Handles all the technical complexity for you

## How Our Vaults Work

### 1. Asset Deposit
When you deposit assets into a vault, they're held in a smart contract that acts as your automated investment manager.

### 2. Strategy Execution
The vault automatically:
- Analyzes current market conditions
- Identifies the best yield opportunities
- Executes trades across multiple protocols
- Manages risk through diversification

### 3. Continuous Optimization
Our vaults don't just "set and forget" - they actively:
- Monitor yield rates across protocols
- Rebalance when better opportunities arise
- Adjust risk parameters based on market conditions
- Optimize gas usage for efficiency

### 4. Yield Distribution
Returns are automatically:
- Compounded back into the vault
- Tracked transparently on-chain
- Available for withdrawal at any time

## Vault Architecture

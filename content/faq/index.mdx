# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is Muscadine Labs?
Muscadine Labs is a DeFi infrastructure company that creates automated yield strategies through vault contracts. We simplify complex DeFi operations while maintaining transparency and security.

### How do Muscadine vaults work?
Our vaults are smart contracts that automatically manage your DeFi assets. They deposit funds across multiple protocols, continuously optimize for the best yields, and handle rebalancing automatically.

### What networks do you support?
Currently, all Muscadine vaults operate on the **Base** network. We may expand to additional networks based on user demand and technical feasibility.

## Vault Operations

### How do I deposit into a vault?
1. Connect your wallet to the Base network
2. Navigate to the vault contract address
3. Call the deposit function with your desired amount
4. Confirm the transaction in your wallet

### Can I withdraw my funds anytime?
Yes, all Muscadine vaults support instant withdrawals with no lock-up periods. However, you may need to wait for the next rebalancing cycle in some cases.

### What is the minimum deposit amount?
There is no minimum deposit amount for Muscadine vaults. You can start with any amount you're comfortable with.

### How often do vaults rebalance?
Rebalancing frequency depends on market conditions and strategy optimization opportunities. Typically, vaults rebalance when significant yield improvements are available.

## Fees and Economics

### What fees do you charge?
Muscadine Labs charges a **1% performance fee** on vault profits. This fee is only applied to gains, never to your principal investment.

### When are fees charged?
Performance fees are charged when:
- You withdraw funds from a vault
- The vault rebalances positions
- Periodic fee collection cycles occur

### Are there any other costs?
You'll pay Ethereum gas fees for transactions, but these go to network validators, not Muscadine Labs. We optimize operations to minimize gas costs.

### How do I track my returns?
All vault performance is tracked on-chain and visible through blockchain explorers. You can also monitor performance through our interface.

## Security and Risk

### Are Muscadine vaults audited?
Yes, all vault contracts undergo professional security audits before deployment. Audit reports are publicly available.

### What are the main risks?
Key risks include:
- Smart contract vulnerabilities
- Market volatility
- Protocol failures
- Liquidity constraints
- Oracle manipulation

### How do you manage risk?
We employ a comprehensive risk management framework including:
- Protocol diversification
- Continuous monitoring
- Emergency controls
- Regular security assessments

### Can I lose my funds?
Yes, DeFi protocols carry inherent risks. While we implement extensive risk management, you could lose funds due to smart contract bugs, market conditions, or protocol failures.

## Technical Questions

### What wallets are supported?
Any wallet that supports the Base network, including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and others.

### How do I verify contract addresses?
Always verify contract addresses on [BaseScan](https://basescan.org) before interacting. Our official addresses are listed in our [Contracts](/contracts) documentation.

### Can I interact with vaults programmatically?
Yes, all vault functions are available through smart contract interfaces. Check our contract documentation for ABI details.

### What happens if Base network has issues?
In case of network issues, vault operations may be temporarily paused. Emergency procedures are in place to protect user funds.
